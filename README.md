# Interview-Practice-Problems

A few interview practice problems that I have worked on over the summer that are here to help anyone who is stuck on the problem. It is composed of different folders, each with their own types of problems ranging from strings to stacks. Each file is seperated into 3 parts, the problem prompt, the solution, and the process to how the problem was solved. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

You can look through the folders individually to find problems or just clone this repository to your terminal if you like.
